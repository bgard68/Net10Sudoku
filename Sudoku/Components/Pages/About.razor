        <h2>What is Sudoku?</h2>
        <p>
            Sudoku is a logic-based number-placement puzzle. The objective is to fill a 9×9 grid with digits 
            from 1 to 9 so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3×3 subgrids (also called "boxes" 
            or "regions") contains all of the digits from 1 to 9 without repetition.
        </p>
        <p>
            The puzzle setter provides a partially completed grid, which for a well-posed puzzle has a single 
            unique solution. Sudoku puzzles come in various difficulty levels, from Easy (with more given numbers) 
            to Professional (with fewer clues, requiring advanced solving techniques).

            <h3>The Name</h3>
            <p>
                "Sudoku" is an abbreviation of the Japanese phrase <em>"S?ji wa dokushin ni kagiru"</em> (????????), 
                which means "the digits must be single" or "the digits are limited to one occurrence."
            </p>

            <h3>Modern Popularity</h3>
            <p>
                Today, Sudoku is one of the most popular logic puzzles in the world. It has spawned numerous variations, 
                competitions, and even world championships. The puzzle's appeal lies in its simple rules combined with 
                deep logical complexity—easy to learn but challenging to master.
